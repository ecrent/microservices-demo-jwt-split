# Attribution and Licensing

## Original Work

This project is based on **Google Cloud Platform's microservices-demo**:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo
- **Copyright**: Google LLC
- **License**: Apache License 2.0
- **Original Purpose**: Demonstration of cloud-native microservices architecture and Google Cloud Platform services

**Key Research Contributions**:
1. Implementation of JWT compression using split headers (x-jwt-static, x-jwt-session, x-jwt-dynamic, x-jwt-sig)
2. Comparative performance analysis of compressed vs. uncompressed JWT tokens
3. Network bandwidth optimization through HTTP/2 HPACK caching
4. Load testing methodology for authentication overhead measurement

## Modified Files and Components

### Core Service Modifications
The following services have been modified to support JWT authentication and compression:
- `src/frontend/` - Added JWT middleware and compression logic
- `src/cartservice/` - JWT validation and header processing
- `src/checkoutservice/` - JWT authentication integration
- `src/shippingservice/` - JWT validation
- `src/paymentservice/` - JWT processing
- `src/emailservice/` - JWT integration

### Kubernetes Manifests
All service deployment YAML files have been extended with:
- `ENABLE_JWT_COMPRESSION` environment variable
- JWT-related configuration options

### Testing Infrastructure (New)
All testing scripts and tools are original contributions for this research:
- `enable_jwt_compression.sh`
- `disable_jwt_compression.sh`
- `run-jwt-compression-test.sh`
- `wsl-run-jwt-compression-test.sh`
- `compare-jwt-compression-enhanced.sh`
- `k6-user-journey-test.js`
- `JWT-COMPRESSION-TEST-GUIDE.md`

### Documentation (New)
Research-specific documentation:
- `JWT-COMPRESSION-TEST-GUIDE.md` - Complete testing guide
- `results.md` - Performance analysis results
- `forme.md` - Research notes and findings

## Preserved Original Code

The following aspects of the original codebase remain largely unchanged:
- Core microservices architecture and communication patterns
- gRPC protocol buffer definitions
- Frontend user interface and UX
- Business logic for e-commerce functionality
- Database and caching implementations
- Service mesh and observability configurations
