  Purpose: 
    This repository has been extended as part of a master's thesis research project
    studying JWT (JSON Web Token) compression and optimization in microservices
    architectures.

  Key Modifications:
    1. Added JWT authentication system across all microservices
    2. Implemented JWT compression feature using split headers for HTTP/2 HPACK optimization
    3. Added ENABLE_JWT_COMPRESSION environment variable to services:
       - frontend
       - cartservice
       - checkoutservice
       - shippingservice
       - paymentservice
       - emailservice
    
    4. Created testing and comparison tools:
       - enable_jwt_compression.sh
       - disable_jwt_compression.sh
       - run-jwt-compression-test.sh
       - wsl-run-jwt-compression-test.sh
       - compare-jwt-compression-enhanced.sh
       - k6-user-journey-test.js
    
    5. Added comprehensive test documentation:
       - JWT-COMPRESSION-TEST-GUIDE.md
       - results.md
       - forme.md
    
    6. Modified service implementations to support:
       - JWT compression using x-jwt-static, x-jwt-session, x-jwt-dynamic, x-jwt-sig headers
       - Traditional JWT using Authorization: Bearer header
       - Performance comparison and metrics collection

  Areas of Original Code Preserved:
    - Core microservices architecture
    - gRPC communication patterns
    - Kubernetes deployment manifests (extended with new environment variables)
    - Frontend UI and user experience
    - Product catalog, cart, checkout, and payment logic
    - Original service dependencies and interactions

Third-Party Components:
  This project continues to use all third-party components from the original
  microservices-demo project. Please refer to the original repository for
  complete dependency information.

  This modified version is intended for academic research purposes as part of
  a master's thesis. The modifications demonstrate the application of JWT
  compression techniques in a realistic microservices environment.
